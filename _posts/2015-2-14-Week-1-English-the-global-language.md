## 1 被动语态 passive

* 人物主动关系问题，不知道动作实施人，就用被动；
* 根据想要表达的重点或感兴趣的，来使用主动与被动，进行强调。

We make the passive using ‘be’ and the past participle (‘done’, ‘played’ etc.). We use the passive:

	1 When we don’t know, or we are not interested in, who does an action**.

    	In the past, new words were coined.
    	We don’t know who invented the words.

    	English is used in education, in science and in business.
    	It’s not important who uses English in these contexts.

    2 When the main topic of the sentence isn’t the person who did the action.

    	The word ‘robot’ was coined in the 1920s by the writer Karel Čapek.
    	The main topic here is the word ‘robot’, not the person who invented it.

**In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence.**

	The passive can be used with all tenses. We change the form of ‘be’.

	Shakespeare’s plays are performed all over the world.

	His works have been translated into many different languages.

	Many of Shakespeare’s plays were first performed at the Globe Theatre in London.

	Hamlet will be performed in every country in the world as part of a tour called ‘Globe to Globe Hamlet’ which started in April 2014.

3个词组在英语解释中经常用到，特意记录。

### in the sense that

Some words and phrases have several meanings, or ‘senses’.

    It’s an international company in the sense that its employees are from all over the world.  
    It’s an international company in the sense that it has offices in several different countries.

When we say ‘in the sense that’, we show exactly which meaning we are using.

    English is a global language in the sense that it is used in many different contexts.

### in a geographic sense

The phrase ‘in a geographic sense’ shows **which particular meaning we are using**.

    Cantonese is a global language, in a geographic sense.

Cantonese is spoken in many different places so it is global in one way, but it isn’t used in as many different contexts as English.

### in terms of

When we say ‘in terms of’, we explain **how we are thinking about or measuring something**.

    English is the global language both in terms of the number of speakers and its global reach.
